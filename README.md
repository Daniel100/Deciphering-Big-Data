## Summary - Collaborative Discussion 1: Internet of Things (IoT)

The exciting field of the Internet of Things (IoT) is defined by Gokhale et al. (2018) as the internet connected with physical objects, and it enables various items such as electronic devices and sensors (wearable health monitors, connected appliances, smart home security systems, logistics tracking) and more to collect and exchange data.

The collected and exchanged data from IoT devices can be very large and heterogeneous; it is a substantial contributor to Big Data, which is why there is a strong tie between IoT and Big Data (Cecchinel et al., 2014, as cited in Zainab et al., 2015: 41).

Marjani et al. (2017) highlight the benefits for organisations, businesses and individuals originating from the ability to analyse and utilise IoT data; for example, smart cities, smart transport and smart factory equipment, among others.

However, raw IoT data is mostly useless without the ability to analyse it (Marjani et al., 2017). Therefore, Sarkar (2019) stated the importance of data processing; this set of tasks is known as Data Wrangling.

Huxley (2020) elaborates on the quality of quantitative data and the ability to make the data usable for planned analysis.

Messy data can be viewed as unorganised or unstructured data; because most analyses require a tabular format (Huxley, 2020). I agree with Sieminski (2023, as cited in Yair 2022) that messy data can mean many things more than the one above, and Yair (2022) provides a more detailed definition. Sieminski (2023, as cited in Routhu 2022) states that sometimes messy data regarding structured data implies that the data needs to be transformed into an analysis-ready format; it may simply mean that the data must undergo a normalisation process.

Furthermore, data cleaning is crucial because otherwise, the risk is high that inaccurate results and conclusions are drawn from the analysis (Huxley, 2020).

Data Cleaning in the context of Big Data comes with limitations; it is time-consuming and requires domain expertise to achieve clean data (Ridzuan, 2019).

On the one side, humans outperform automated data-cleaning techniques (Geiger, 2023, as cited in Ding et al., 2022). On the other side, researchers, as mentioned in Geiger (2023, as cited in Shi et al. 2021), state that automated data cleaning tools improve data accuracy much faster than humans.

In Wong (2023, as cited in Horn, 2019) pointed out that humans are more likely to make errors than in automated data-cleaning processes.

Khalid (2023, as cited in Bhatt, 2020) pointed out that this time constraint mentioned above can be overcome by using data cleaning services, for example, by companies such as Experian (2021).

Tankard (2012) highlights the security issues in the context of Big Data since the data is primarily centrally stored in one place for analysis; data could be disclosed by human error or through attackers. Therefore, the data needs to be stored safely and protected, and all regulations need to be met (Tankard, 2012).

## Team Project

Project Team: Group 2

### INTRODUCTION
Our client, a successful barbershop located in the UK, requires measurement of the shop’s turnover to plan the budget, manage taxes and human resources. Furthermore, employee performance needs to be evaluated regularly since it is crucial for the clients success.

### CURRENT SITUATION
Currently, our client performs the time-consuming task of manually arranging, processing, and storing data in spreadsheets to create reports daily. This data comes from four separate sources: cash registers, customers, employees, and service. The system’s weakness lies in the disconnected data sources and the manual process.

### DATA PROCESS ARCHITECTURE
To tackle the lack of integration and manual process, the most beneficial solution is a fully automated and optimised cloud platform. This will enable the client to focus on other core areas whilst still generating reports and insights vital to the running of the business.

Our solution starts with setting up an e-commerce web application service for handling transactions, customer data, and services; it will be the single point of truth for raw data.

The next step is to set up a GCP account with BigQuery (free tier) because this will suit the small volume of data the client will be storing and processing. It is also equipped with top-tier security measures, managed directly by Google.

After the GCP account is created, data loads through an API from the e-commerce web application to the GCP.

Whilst the technical preconditions are now established, our data would still be considered raw data. Thus, a data pipeline must be implemented for transforming and cleaning the data.

The software service, DBT, will be used for the data engineering workflow - creating the ETL for these tasks. Furthermore, this tool has version control, documentation, and a testing framework which we will utilise to develop a reliable data pipeline resulting in a DWH.

Since data quality is crucial, we will implement a data testing strategy to detect inconsistencies such as outliers and formatting errors. Additionally, we will create user profiles for all used services to guarantee safe access management.

After this, the data is considered clean; automated queries will be created to gather the data. The data will be available via Google Sheets and guarantee our client a flexible way to analyse the data.

The graphical description of the data process can be found here .
